  ## Description: 
  -  Feel like you are forgetful? Never forget things again because with this note taking application you can write down your thoughts on the fly! I was motivated to build this note taking application because myself and a lot of others have issues remembering so much information throughout our busy lives. During the process of building the notes app I learned how to work with and operate methods such as GET, POST, and DELETE.
